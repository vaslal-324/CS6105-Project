# CS6105-Project
12 Hour Clock simulation using Logisim software

This project aims to explain the designing, implementation and  functioning of a basic 12 hour digital clock which is capable of showing hours and minutes . The circuit for the clock was made using LOGISIM Software for Digital Simulation . 

Main components of the Clock :
BCD TO SEVEN SEGMENT DECODER\n 
12 HOUR COUNTER\n 
MOD 6 COUNTER\n
MOD 10 COUNTER\n
7 SEGMENT DISPLAY\n
CLOCK INPUT\n 
ENABLE SWITCH
